            <p>
                The Villanova Ride Share Project is designed to
                 make commuting easier and more efficient for the
                Villanova community. Users can sign up to share
                rides, offering or seeking transportation within
                the vicinity of Villanova. To get started, simply
                register and create your profile. Once logged in,
                you can add a ride by specifying details such as
                date, time, and destination, or browse existing
                rides and join one that fits your schedule. 
                For added convenience, users can also add their
                cars to the database, providing details like make
                , model, and mileage, which helps in organizing 
                and managing rides. Safety, reliability, and 
                community spirit are the driving aim of this project,
                aiming to foster a culture of shared commuting and environmental
                responsibility among Villanova students.
